# Black Epsilon Lab

**Black Epsilon Lab** is my private precision workshop and tech lab in Sofia, Bulgaria — a ~50 m² space that combines a small machine shop, metrology and microscopy, custom power and networking, and a dev corner for software and AI-assisted work.

This repository documents the lab, its capabilities, and its evolution.

> Built end-to-end by one person: electricals, drywall, plumbing, finishing, lighting design, machine layout, and tooling.

## 🏠 Overview

- **Location:** Sofia, Bulgaria  
- **Owner:** Apostol Valentinov Apostolov (founder of Black Epsilon Ltd.)  
- **Area:** ~50 m² total  
  - Front **office** and reception  
  - **Shop** / lab space  
  - Small **storage/service** area  
  - **Bathroom**

The lab is designed as a clean, white-walled environment rather than a dark, oily workshop. It’s intended for **small, precise, one-off or short-run work**, experiments, and prototyping — not heavy industrial production.

## 🧰 Capabilities

### 1. Machining & Fabrication

The shop is equipped for light-to-medium precision work, fixtures, and custom parts:

- **Manual machining**
  - Bench **lathe** (precision turning, facing, boring)
  - Bench **mill** (slotting, drilling, light milling)
  - **Drill press** / column drill
- **Small CNC**
  - Desktop **CNC router** (originally an engraver) for 2.5D machining, engraving, and light routing in metals and plastics
- **Sheet metal & finishing**
  - Small **press brake** / bending tools
  - Mechanical **press**
  - **Belt + disc sander** and other finishing tools
- **General shop tools**
  - Multiple heavy red/grey workbenches
  - Vises, clamps, files, saws, hand tools
  - Gas equipment for cutting/welding (oxy-based set)

Focus: **small, precise components**, adapters, brackets, bushings, fixtures, housings — the kind of parts where geometry and fit matter more than volume.

### 2. Metrology & Measurement

A dedicated metrology corner supports accurate measurement and layout:

- **Surface plate** on its own stand
- **Gauge blocks** and reference blocks
- **Micrometers**, digital and dial **calipers**
- **Dial indicators** with magnetic bases (standard and flexible arms)
- **Angle and level gauges**, parallels, 1-2-3 blocks and similar tools

This allows for proper alignment, inspection, and verification of machined parts, jigs, and assemblies.

---

### 3. Microscopy & Inspection

A separate station is dedicated to visual inspection and materials/geometry observation:

- **Zeiss Laboval 4** microscope with:
  - 40×, 100×, 400×, 1000× objectives (the higher magnifications oil-immersion)
- Camera mounted in the eyepiece
- Dedicated computer for live view, capture, and documentation
- Mounted on a **stainless steel table** in a clean corner of the lab

Typical uses:

- Inspecting tool wear and cutting edges
- Examining surface finishes and defects
- Looking at contamination, cracks, and micro-features
- Documenting failure analysis with images

---

### 4. Power, Electrical & Lighting

The infrastructure is designed and installed entirely by hand:

- **Power**
  - 50 A / 240 V supply
  - Distribution panel on the lab wall
  - Multiple circuits and outlets chased into the drywall around the room
- **Lighting**

  Carefully zoned so each area can be lit independently:

  - Bright overhead LED panels:
    - Dedicated zones for:
      - Lathe & mill bench
      - Window-side wall and general-purpose bench
  - Low-intensity 5 W lights for relaxed evening presence and screen work
  - Directed task lighting:
    - Spot for the surface plate
    - Spot for the main general-purpose bench
  - **Hidden LED strips** along the tool walls of the benches for additional local light

In the front office:

- One **warm (3000 K)** and one **neutral (4000 K)** ceiling light, for comfortable work and client meetings.

The end result: you can light just the area you’re working in — from “surgical light over the machine” to “soft light while watching something in the evening”.

---

### 5. Water & Cleanup

The lab includes:

- A large **ceramic sink** with proper drainage
- Storage and work surfaces around the sink
- Cleaning tools, solvents, and consumables organised nearby

This makes it practical to wash parts, clean tools, and keep the shop closer to “lab clean” than “garage dirty”.

---

### 6. Network & Computing

There is a small but solid network and computing setup:

- **Rack infrastructure**
  - 16U rack
  - Rack switch
  - PDU
  - Legacy rack server (kept as spare/experimental hardware)
- **Workstations**
  - Dedicated PC for the microscope station
  - Dev/office PCs in the front room and in the shop
  - TV/monitor on the wall for diagrams, documentation, and visualisation
- **Network design**
  - Segmented lab network inspired by zero-trust principles
  - Plan for separating machine/control traffic, office/dev traffic, and external connectivity

This is the physical counterpart to the software work (e.g. the Copernican Suite), making it possible to run simulations, code, and measurement/inspection from the same physical space.

## 🧪 Typical Use Cases

Some of the things this lab is good at:

- Designing and machining **small one-off parts**: spacers, bushings, adapters, brackets
- Building and tuning **fixtures and jigs** for experiments or small production runs
- Performing **inspection and measurement** on parts that require verifiable dimensions
- Running **experiments and prototypes** that need both physical hardware and computational analysis
- Combining **microscopic inspection** with mechanical repair or improvement

The lab is not a production factory; it is a **precision workshop and experimentation space**, aimed at quality and learning rather than volume.

## 🧱 How the Lab Was Built

This space wasn’t just equipped; it was **rebuilt**:

- Identified and fixed external water ingress
- Cut out and replaced soaked drywall with **water-resistant board**
- Routed and installed new **electrical lines** all around the room
- Closed channels with filler, replastered, primed and painted with white alkyd
- Replaced the entire **suspended ceiling**:
  - New ceiling tiles
  - Repainted grid
  - Installed new lighting in carefully planned zones
- Built a separating wall and installed a reclaimed door between the office and the shop
- Installed plumbing and the large ceramic sink
- Designed and placed the benches, surface plate stand, microscope table, and machine layout

All of this was done by one person, learning multiple trades in the process.

## 🧠 Philosophy

Black Epsilon Lab exists to bridge:

- **Physical reality** — metal, glass, tools, chips, coolant, measurements  
- **Abstract structure** — equations, simulations, software like the Copernican Suite  
- **Human experience** — language, communication, and the stubborn urge to understand how things work

Most of the “design” for the lab lived in a **whiteboard and in my head** — an informal CAD system of spatial reasoning, iteration, and adjustment. Formal CAD is used for parts and fixtures; the room itself is the result of lived-in design.

Black Epsilon Lab is the physical counterpart to software like Copernican: where simulations, models and numerical experiments can eventually meet real instruments, fixtures, and test setups.
